            and wealth with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
            Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface
            (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in
            1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with
            the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.</h5>
